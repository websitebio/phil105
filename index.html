      <p class="about-paragraph">
        This course covers the concept of arguments and how to identify and analyze them. It also covers the concepts of statements, non-arguments, vagueness, ambiguity, generalizations, biases, and dispositions. Students should be able to identify arguments and non-arguments, identify statements and non-statements, resolve vagueness and ambiguity, identify different types of generalizations, identify confirmation bias, reflect on their own open-mindedness, and understand the influence of their own worldview. They should also be able to define terms such as argument, premise, conclusion, premise indicator, conclusion indicator, disposition, open-mindedness, psychological bias, confirmation bias, and worldview. The course also covers the process of evaluating arguments, including considering the evidence, context, and alternative explanations, as well as identifying fallacies in reasoning.

      <h1 class="title about">Module 2 - Standard form</h1>
      <p class="about-paragraph">
        Standard form is a way of constructing an argument in a way that is easier to understand and examine. It involves separating the conclusion of an argument from its premises, which are the statements that support the conclusion. To put a long, complex argument into standard form, you need to identify the main conclusion, separate it from irrelevant statements, and arrange the relevant premises in order. Sub-arguments are arguments within the main argument, and their conclusions serve as premises for the main argument. Missing statements, also known as suppressed premises, are statements that are left out of an argument because they are considered common sense or too obvious. It is important to identify and include these statements in order to make a valid argument. The availability heuristic is a cognitive bias that affects the way people make decisions, and fallacies of appeal are types of fallacious arguments that use emotional or personal appeals rather than logical reasoning.

      <h1 class="title about">Module 3 - Deductive Arguments</h1>
      <p class="about-paragraph">
        In summary, the content covers the standards for evaluating deductive and non-deductive arguments, the concept of argument form and how it can be used to identify valid deductive arguments, the use of counter-examples to test the validity of an argument, and common formal fallacies to watch out for in deductive arguments. It also mentions that deductive arguments are rare in practice because it is difficult to find true premises and because non-deductive arguments are often more useful in the empirical world.

      <h1 class="title about">Module 4 - Non Deductive Arguments</h1>
      <p class="about-paragraph">
        The three learning outcomes of this course are being able to classify arguments as deductive or non-deductive, evaluate the strength of a non-deductive argument, and identify fallacies of relevance and examples of the framing effect. The conceptual competencies include understanding the differences between deductive and non-deductive arguments, the criteria for evaluating the strength of a non-deductive argument, the role of counter-examples in evaluating non-deductive arguments, the importance of the Principle of Charity in critical thinking, and the concept of the framing effect. The course also introduces terminology such as non-deductive, strong, weak, effective counter-example, exception, reasoning gap, irrelevant premise, Principle of Charity, charity, fallacy of relevance, and framing effect.

      <h1 class="title about">Module 5 - Argument Evaluation</h1>
       <p class="about-paragraph">
       The summary of this module is that it teaches students how to evaluate arguments, including how to classify an argument as deductive or non-deductive, how to determine if a deductive argument is valid or invalid, and how to evaluate the strength of a non-deductive argument. It also covers concepts such as argument form, counter-examples, formal fallacies, acceptable and unacceptable premises, and the principle of charity. The module emphasizes the importance of being able to evaluate arguments in order to reach well-supported conclusions and avoid reasoning errors.

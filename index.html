      <p class="about-paragraph">
        This course covers the concept of arguments and how to identify and analyze them. It also covers the concepts of statements, non-arguments, vagueness, ambiguity, generalizations, biases, and dispositions. Students should be able to identify arguments and non-arguments, identify statements and non-statements, resolve vagueness and ambiguity, identify different types of generalizations, identify confirmation bias, reflect on their own open-mindedness, and understand the influence of their own worldview. They should also be able to define terms such as argument, premise, conclusion, premise indicator, conclusion indicator, disposition, open-mindedness, psychological bias, confirmation bias, and worldview. The course also covers the process of evaluating arguments, including considering the evidence, context, and alternative explanations, as well as identifying fallacies in reasoning.

      <h1 class="title about">Module 2 - Standard Form</h1>
      <p class="about-paragraph">
        Standard form is a way of constructing an argument in a way that is easier to understand and examine. It involves separating the conclusion of an argument from its premises, which are the statements that support the conclusion. To put a long, complex argument into standard form, you need to identify the main conclusion, separate it from irrelevant statements, and arrange the relevant premises in order. Sub-arguments are arguments within the main argument, and their conclusions serve as premises for the main argument. Missing statements, also known as suppressed premises, are statements that are left out of an argument because they are considered common sense or too obvious. It is important to identify and include these statements in order to make a valid argument. The availability heuristic is a cognitive bias that affects the way people make decisions, and fallacies of appeal are types of fallacious arguments that use emotional or personal appeals rather than logical reasoning.

      <p class="about-paragraph">
        In summary, the content covers the standards for evaluating deductive and non-deductive arguments, the concept of argument form and how it can be used to identify valid deductive arguments, the use of counter-examples to test the validity of an argument, and common formal fallacies to watch out for in deductive arguments. It also mentions that deductive arguments are rare in practice because it is difficult to find true premises and because non-deductive arguments are often more useful in the empirical world.

      <p class="about-paragraph">
        The three learning outcomes of this course are being able to classify arguments as deductive or non-deductive, evaluate the strength of a non-deductive argument, and identify fallacies of relevance and examples of the framing effect. The conceptual competencies include understanding the differences between deductive and non-deductive arguments, the criteria for evaluating the strength of a non-deductive argument, the role of counter-examples in evaluating non-deductive arguments, the importance of the Principle of Charity in critical thinking, and the concept of the framing effect. The course also introduces terminology such as non-deductive, strong, weak, effective counter-example, exception, reasoning gap, irrelevant premise, Principle of Charity, charity, fallacy of relevance, and framing effect.

       <p class="about-paragraph">
       The summary of this module is that it teaches students how to evaluate arguments, including how to classify an argument as deductive or non-deductive, how to determine if a deductive argument is valid or invalid, and how to evaluate the strength of a non-deductive argument. It also covers concepts such as argument form, counter-examples, formal fallacies, acceptable and unacceptable premises, and the principle of charity. The module emphasizes the importance of being able to evaluate arguments in order to reach well-supported conclusions and avoid reasoning errors.

   <div class="about-card card" id="5"> <h1 class="title about">Module 2: Standard forms
</h1> <p class="about-paragraph">In the study of reasoning and argumentation, it is important to be able to present arguments in a clear and structured way. The standard form of an argument is a widely-used tool for doing this. It involves presenting the premises of an argument (the reasons given to support a conclusion) followed by the conclusion itself. The conclusion is typically signalled by the word "therefore". An example of an argument in standard form is: "P1: All mammals are warm-blooded. P2: Dogs are mammals. Therefore, C: Dogs are warm-blooded." The standard form of an argument is useful because

</div>Module 2: Example
<div class="about-card card" id="5"> <h1 class="title about">Module 2: Example
</h1> <p class="about-paragraph">In the study of reasoning and argumentation, it is important to be able to identify the main conclusion and premises of an argument in order to assess its logic and evaluate its truth. Long and complex arguments can be challenging to analyze because they may include additional information that is not directly related to the argument itself, such as examples and illustrations. To analyze a long and complex argument, it can be helpful to identify and remove this extraneous information in order to isolate the main argument. This can be done by identifying the main conclusion and looking for statements that provide support for it. Once the argument has been isolated, it can be presented in standard form, which makes it easier to evaluate. An example of a long and complex argument and the process of analyzing and putting it in standard form is provided in the passage.



</div>Module 2: Sub-Arguments
<div class="about-card card" id="5"> <h1 class="title about">Module 2: Sub-Arguments
</h1> <p class="about-paragraph">In order to understand a long and complex argument, it is important to identify the main conclusion and the premises that support it. This process involves identifying the individual statements that make up the argument and determining their role in the argument. Some statements may serve as both the conclusion of one argument and a premise in another. These are known as sub-conclusions, and the arguments they belong to are known as sub-arguments. To analyze a complex argument, it can be helpful to identify and isolate sub-arguments by identifying the main conclusion and looking for premises that are supported by reasons. It is also important to note that if a premise is supported by a sub-conclusion that it also supports, the argument may be circular.



</div>Module 2: Missing statements
<div class="about-card card" id="5"> <h1 class="title about">Module 2: Missing statements
</h1> <p class="about-paragraph">In this lesson, the concept of suppressed premises and suppressed conclusions in arguments was introduced. A suppressed premise is a statement that is a necessary part of an argument but is not explicitly provided. When this occurs, it is important to include the suppressed premise in the standard form of the argument in order to properly evaluate it. On the other hand, a suppressed conclusion is the conclusion of an argument that is not provided. In this case, it is important to come up with a conclusion that is supported by the premises given in the argument. It is important to be careful when formulating the suppressed conclusion and to make sure it is one that is supported by the premises that are provided. In both cases, it is important to practice identifying and including suppressed premises and conclusions in order to properly evaluate arguments.



</div>Module 2: Linking Principles
<div class="about-card card" id="5"> <h1 class="title about">Module 2: Linking Principles
</h1> <p class="about-paragraph">The Conclusion Linking principle states that any important information, phrase, or term in the conclusion of an argument must be in a premise. This is useful for detecting suppressed premises or missing parts of existing premises. The Premise Linking principle states that any important information, phrase, or term in a premise must also be in another premise. This helps to ensure that the premises of an argument fit together properly and support the conclusion. When applying these principles to a larger argument

These views and opinions are based on complex reasons presented in the stories. The viewer is encouraged to watch one of the videos and consider any opinions or views that they formed while watching.



</div>Module 2: Motivated Reasoning
<div class="about-card card" id="5"> <h1 class="title about">Module 2: Motivated Reasoning
</h1> <p class="about-paragraph">Motivated reasoning refers to the tendency for people to search for evidence that supports their preexisting beliefs or desires, rather than objectively evaluating all available evidence. This can occur when trying to justify a conclusion one has already come to or when reasoning towards a new conclusion based on existing knowledge. Motivated reasoning can be influenced by a desire to seem rational or to persuade others, and can lead to biased evaluation of evidence and flawed decision-making. Research has shown that people are more likely to critically evaluate evidence that goes against their beliefs

</div>Module 2: Psych: Availability Heuristic
<div class="about-card card" id="5"> <h1 class="title about">Module 2: Psych: Availability Heuristic
</h1> <p class="about-paragraph">The Availability Heuristic is a psychological bias that causes people to judge the probability of an event based on how easily examples of it come to mind, rather than considering all alternatives and calculating the real probability. This bias can lead to poor decision-making, as the ease with which something comes to mind is not necessarily related to its probability. For example, people may overestimate the likelihood of rare but highly publicized events, such as plane crashes or shark attacks, because they are easily remembered. To counteract the Availability Heuristic, it is important to be aware of it and to try to consider all relevant information when making decisions.
